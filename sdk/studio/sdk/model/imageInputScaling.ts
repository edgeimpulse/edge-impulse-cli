/**
* Normalization that is applied to images. If this is not set then 0..1 is used. \"0..1\" gives you non-normalized pixels between 0 and 1. \"-1..1\" gives you non-normalized pixels between -1 and 1. \"0..255\" gives you non-normalized pixels between 0 and 255. \"-128..127\" gives you non-normalized pixels between -128 and 127. \"torch\" first scales pixels between 0 and 1, then applies normalization using the ImageNet dataset (same as `torchvision.transforms.Normalize()`). \"bgr-subtract-imagenet-mean\" scales to 0..255, reorders pixels to BGR, and subtracts the ImageNet mean from each channel.
